/* steps 
our function's goal to iterate through an array of numbers and return the element that is not repeated 
1- first step is to check whether the array entered by the user is empty or not , if so , the function will automatically return null 
2- otherwise , we are going to create a for loop  that starts from 0 till the end of the array(arr.length-1) that will iterate 
through the array inside the loop itself we are going to create another loop with the same parametr of the first loop its role is to 
keep track of the iterated elements of the array and store their values
