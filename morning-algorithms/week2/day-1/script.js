// we will create a function with one parameter (which is an array) and this array contains an odd set of numbers
//the function's goal is to return the element that has no matching pair in the given array
//steps :
// 1 - first step is to check for the array's length ,if it is equal to 1 the function will automatically return  
//the only element of the array with the index arr[0]
// we declare a variable and we assign to it 
// 2 - else we will create a for loop that will iterate through the given array and check if each element of the 
//array has a matching pair and finally return the element that is left with no pair
